#Game Story
Iron man and Warmachine are challenging each others again. Every one of them claims to be the best pilot of the MARK-n suit.
To end it once and for all they agreed to do the next:
Two players jump from a plane(the top of our page). Each one of them wears a parachute and an Iron Man suit.
The suit helps him to control his position(x, y) while falling, he can go up, down, right, and left.
When his suit is not working he will continue falling in the same (x, y). 
There are some random horizontal barriers appears on their way which moving upward (it's not actually moving but it will appear like that on the screen as the player is falling towards it) .
If a player hits one of the barriers, his health will be decreasing. The two players can attack each other.
The victim will be frozen and can't control his suit for a certain time, so he will not be able to avoid the barriers and may get hit. 
The winner is the one who keeps alive. They will continue falling untill on of them dies
